# Google_Calendar_Sync_POC
a proof of concept about google calendar and syncing capabilities using Express.js\

# using the POC
- run npm install to install the project.
- for the next part I created a python script that you can run on the credentials json you can download from the google cloud platform for convenience. Once you downloaded the google cloud credentials, rename it credentials.json and put it at the root of the project. then run python3 env_file_extractor.py
- create a .env file : 
    YOU MUST PUT YOUR .ENV FILE IN A vars folder
    do the following command
    mkdir vars && touch vars/.env
- open it using your favorite code editor and fill it up with the elements required. Use the .env.example file to know what you need to put in it.
